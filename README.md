# Advent of Code 2021

Solutions to the [AoC 2021](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles - each in a separate Jupyter notebook.
Puzzle inputs need to be downloaded separaterly and named corresponding to the inputs in notebooks (initially I included them in the repo, before finding out [that's discouraged](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about#faq_copying)). Additionally, store pythonised versions of the notebooks for easier diffs.
